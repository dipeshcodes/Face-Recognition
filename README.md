# Face Recognition with OpenCV and Python



- **Training Data Gathering:** Gather data ( images in this case)  you want to recognize
- **Training of Recognizer:** Feed that data (and respective names of each face) to the recognizer so that it can learn.
- **Recognition:** Feed new data s and see if the recognizer you just trained recognizes them.
